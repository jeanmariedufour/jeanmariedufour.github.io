The data are the annual data series analyzed by Pindyck (1999), which we have updated through 2006. The series for crude oil and bituminous
coal span the period from 1870 to 2006, while, for natural gas, the data cover 1919 to 2006.The nominal price series up to 1973 are 
from Manthy (1978) and the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Pindyck (1999) updated these series through 1995 using data from the U.S. Energy Information
Agency (EIA) and, for 1996, the Wall Street Journal. Following Pindyck, we used data from the EIA to update these series through 2006. 
The series are deflated using the U.S. wholesale price index until 1970, and, thereafter, the producers price index which is available from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics website (www.bls.gov). As in Pindyck (1999), all the price data we used in the paper are 1967 real prices. 
Estimation is conducted on the logarithm of real prices. For references cited in this read-me text, please refer to the paper. 

The data set is provided in two files: 
(1) The file named "coal-oil.txt" contains data for crude oil and bituminous coal; 
column 1 is the year (1870-2006), column 2 is log real prices of coal, and column 3 is log real prices of oil.
(2) The file named "gas.txt" contains data for natural gas; column 1 is the year (1919-2006), column 2 is log real prices of gas.
