				My quote on this award: 
				<blockquote> 
				Rational well-informed reflection on public policy issues is one of the most important 
				contributions scholars and scientists can make to society.
                Bad policy decisions can be extremely costly to all of us.
                Research leading to better policies is one the most valuable form of research, 
				arguably the one with the highest rate of return to society.
                The Donner Foundation plays a leading role by recognizing and rewarding this type of research.

                First day of the 5th French Econometrics Conference at the Toulouse School of Economics. 
                Ariel Pakes was the keynote speaker on 
                "Moment Inequalities for Semiparametric Multinomial Choice with Fixed Effects". Emmanuel Flachaire presented our joint paper 
                on permutation tests for comparing inequality measures:

                On November 14-15, I will attend the 5th French Econometrics Conference. 
                I have two papers on the program.

                I went today to the launching ceremony of the new Canadian $5 and $10 bills, made of polymer, 
                at the Canadian Space Agency in Saint-Hubert (Qu&eacute;bec). The ceremony took place because the Canadian arm used 
                by the international space station appears on the $5 dollar bill, along with Sir Wilfrid Laurier. 
                The Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield and the the new Governor of the Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, headed the ceremony. 
                A similar ceremony was simultaneously at the Vancouver central station, because the $10 because has trains for its theme. 
                All Canadian dollar bills are now in polymer. We could visit the installation. I had not realized how big the Canadian space station arm is. 
                It is regularly operated from Saint-Hubert.
